\section{Individual contributions}
The whole project was completed as a team. For sure we took into consideration all the personal backgrounds and  knowledge. That is the reason why Raphael and Manuela focused on implenting the computer code. Whereas Andreas and Fabian concentrated on providing background information, compared the results with the reality and doing its verification.

\section{Introduction and Motivations}
\subsection{Introduction}
The evacuation of a passenger liner due to fire, sinking or other issues leads to several problems. A large amount of passengers try to safe their lives and get to a rescue boat. Narrow and branched floors, smoke, inflowing water, the absence of illumination, rude passengers and so forth can make the evacuation difficult and reduce the number of survivors.
There are a lot of norms how to minimize the harm of such an evacuation. For example there are rules on the number of rescue boats dependent on the amount of passengers \cite{SOLAS}. With dry runs the staff is prepared for the case of emergency et cetera. In real life ship corridor reproduction, the behavior of distressed people is studied.
Another approach is to model such ship evacuations numerically on the computer. As an example the software maritimeEXODUS by a development team from the University of Greenwich is a PC based evacuation and pedestrian dynamics model that is capable of simulating individual people, behaviour and vessel details. The model includes aspects of people-people, people-structure and people-environment interaction. It is capable of simulating thousands of people in very large ship geometries and can incorporate interaction with fire hazard data such as smoke, heat and toxic gases and angle of heel‚Äù \cite{EXODUS}.
Our approach is similarly to model a passenger ship with a common geometrical outline and ground view. In an optimization process we will thereafter look for an ideal ground view, rescue boat distribution and their size to minimize the time needed for evacuation. Finally we will make a statement on possible improvements.
\subsection{Motivation}
Even though modern ocean liners are considered to be safe, the latest occasions attested that there is still potential for evacuation and safety improvements \cite{concordia}. Certainly we know that this science is very advanced and practised since the sinking of the Titanic. Nevertheless knowing that there are still bottlenecks on the ships we are very motivated to detect and eliminate them with our mathematical models.

\subsection{Fundamental Questions}
To find these bottlenecks we run a mathematical model of a ship structure  with several decks and its passengers \cite{shipdecks}. After we localised these places we are interested in the answers of the following questions:

\bigskip
How much time can be saved by varying the dependent variables mentioned below:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much people can be saved by changing the disposition of the specific room types?
\item Where are the bottlenecks during the evacuation? How can they be avoided?
\end{itemize}

What is the influence of the rescue boats?
\begin{itemize}
\item Are small or bigger boats better?
\item Where do they have to be positioned?
\end{itemize}
If we have time to spare we analyse the difference between uncontrolled and controlled passenger flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the crew able to prevent chaos in the evacuation process?
\item What is the best way to lead the passengers out of the ship?
\end{itemize}
In addition we are keen to know if our model is a good abstraction of the reality?








\newpage
\section{Description of the model}
We base our model on the work done by a group of former "MSSSM" students, by name Hans Hardmeier, Andrin Jenal , Beat Kueng and Felix Thaler \cite{Building}. In their work "Modeling Situations of Evacuation in a Multi-level Building" they wrote a computer program in in the language C with a MATLAB interface to rapidly simulate the evacuation of multi-level buildings.\bigskip

\subsection{Social force model }
Our approach is the social force model described by Helbling, Farkas and Vicsek \cite{EscapePanic}. In order to observe an escape panic situation and especially bottlenecks, they built up a continuous-space model. In mathematical terms they took Newtons second law and introduced a mix of socio psychological and physical forces for each so called pedestrian. 

\begin{equation}
m_{i}\frac{\mathsf{d}\mathbf{v}_{i}}{\mathsf{d}t}=m_{i}f_{D}+\sum \limits_{j(\neq{i})}{f_{ij}}+\sum \limits_{W}{f_{iW}}
\end{equation}

Each pedestrian has his own mass and a direction $e_i^0$ in witch he wants to move with a certain velocity $v_i^0$. He tries to adapt his own velocity to the wanted velocity with a given characteristic time $tau_i$.

\begin{equation}
f_{D}=\frac{v_{i}^{0}(t)\mathbf{e}_{i}^{0}(t)-\mathbf{v}_{i}(t)}{\tau_{i}}
\end{equation}

There are additionally interaction forces $f_{ij}$ between the pedestrian and other people including an exponential part for the tendency of two pedestrians to stay away from each other. The second and third term are zero if the two pedestrians are not in touch. Elsewise there is a force in tangential direction $t$ and in radial direction away from each other. 

\begin{equation}
f_{ij} = \left\{A_{i}exp[(r_{ij}-d_{ij})/B_{i}]+kg(r_{ij}-d_{ij})\right\}\mathbf{n}_{ij}+\kappa g(r_{ij}-d_{ij})\triangle v_{ji}^t\mathbf{t}_{ij}
\end{equation}

To be able to handle with walls there is another forces $f_{iW}$ introduced. Its direction is away from the surrounding walls and the structure is similar to the one for the interaction between pedestrians.

\begin{equation}
f_{iW}=\left\{A_{i}exp[(r_{i}-d_{iW})/B_{i}]+kg(r_{i}-d_{iW})\right\}\mathbf{n}_{iW}-\kappa g(r_{i}-d_{iW})(\mathbf{v}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{t}_{iW})\mathbf{t}_{iW}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Ship structure}
To apply the force model on a realistic situation a ship has to be implemented as well. Floor plans from the Costa Serena were taken \cite{shipdecks}. In order to make strong conclusions we want to keep the following variables independent:

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of passengers (4400 agents)
\item Overall capacity of the rescue boats (4680 seats)
\item Ship size and outer shape
\end{itemize}

In order to optimize the evacuation time, we change the following dependent variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stairs and their positions
\item Rescue boat size, number and position
\item Control of the passenger flow by crew members (e.g. is there staff to lead the passengers and how are they doing it?)
\end{itemize}




\newpage
\section{Implementation}
As mentioned above our code is based on the work of a previous project. In order to answer our question we had to make several adjustments and adapt it to our simulation model. In this chapter we are going to explain the most significant changes we did. For the exact understanding of the original code and the process of optimization, please refer to the documentation of the previous project group, especially chapter five and nine\cite{Building} or our code in the Appendix.

\subsection{Basic code}
The builders of the code we base on created a flexible model to simulate building structures. The floors can be feed as graphic data into the system where different colors stand for different areas. Black are walls, red stairs up, blue stairs down, green exits and purpe agent spawning areas. The data is evaluated in matlab in matrices. Information on parameters such as timestep, simulation time, force characteristics et cetera can be read in using a config file which is evaluated on simulation start.\\
With a fast sweeping algorithm in C a vector field is created for every floor pointing in direction of the shortest way towards stairs and exits. In a loop over all passengers the acting forces on them are calculated and via forward Euler converted into velocities. 

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_{i,new} = \mathbf{v}_{i,previous} + \frac{\sum {f}}{m_{i}}dt
\end{equation}

Again with the forward Euler scheme positions are calculated that were reached in a finite timestep.\\

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r}_{i,new}=\mathbf{r}_{i,previous}+\mathbf{v}_{i,new}dt
\end{equation}

\subsection{Code adjustments}
\subsubsection{Exits}
\underline{Reason:}
\newline
The first change which was necessary was due to the fact that the exits in our simulation are not simply on the lowest floor.
\newline
\underline{Assumption:}
\newline
In the case of an emergancy all agents are keen to leave the ship as fast as possible. Therefore in our simulation all passangers above the exits floor are only enabled to move down and passengers lower than the exit floor move upstairs.
\newline
\underline{Function:}
\newline
applyForcesAndMove.m
\newline
\underline{New variables:}
\newline 
To define the floor in which the exits are we introduced a new variable \textit{floor\underline{ }exit} in the config file.
\newline
\underline{Modifications:}
\newline
Since we defined our exit, we are able to easily modify the by splitting the loop, in which we calculate the forces and moves of the agents, in two parts. First we loop over all floors higher than the exit floor in which the agents only are allowed to move down or take an exit. Secondly we do the same for all people in the floors lower than the exit floor where the passengers only can move up or take an exit.
\newline
Because of this modification it is not necessary to loop twice over all floors. Consequently our code remains fast and efficient. We also kept the simple concept of vectors out of booleans. Means for each agent there is one number set: If the agent reaches a staircase and therefore changes the floor he is a 1 otherwise he is a 0. The assumption also is a great simplification for the pictures since we do not have to mess with the problem of having overlapping stairs.

\subsubsection{Different exits}
\underline{Reason:}
\newline
Because the exits model rescueboats, which can only hold a limited number of agents, we were forced to find a way how to differ the exits from each other and to assign a specific number to every exit.
\newline
\underline{Function:}
\newline
loadConfig.m
\newline
\underline{New variables:}
\newline
- \textit{Exit\underline{ }count}, to define the number of exit.\newline
- For each exit k: \textit{exit\underline{ }k\underline{ }nr}, to define the number of agents it can hold.\newline
- To store how many agents can exit in one specific exit, we introduced a matrix exit\underline{ }nr matrix, where the number of agents that can exit is indicated for each pixel.
\underline{Modifications:}
\newline 
We had to make some changes in the decoding of the pictures. The aim was to change as little as possible to the original code. It was clear that we are going to need as many different colors as we have exits, to be able to distinguish them during the simulation.By defining every pixel which is red to value=0, blue value=0 and green value unequal to zero, we can define a lot of different colored exits by using green values from 256 to 256-\textit{exit\underline{ }count}.
\newline
We implemented the matrix \textit{exit\underline{ }nr} similar to the already existing one \textit{img\underline{}exit}, in which we store a count to number the different exits. The number is defined by the green value of  the pixel we are at.

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{tabular}
{|>{\large}m{\textwidth}|} \hline
\bigskip
\textcolor{green}{\%make a zeros matrix as big as img\underline{ }exit}

\newline
\textcolor{green}{\% build the exit\underline{ }nr matrix}
\newline
config.exit\underline{ }nr = config.exit\underline{ }nr + e*( img\underline{ }build(:, :, 1) == 0 \& img\underline{ }build(:, :, 2) == (256-e) \& img\underline{ }build(:, :, 3) == 0 ) ;
\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation of the exit\underline{ }nr matrix}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Closing exits during simulation}

\underline{Reason:}
\newline
To close an exit as soon as it let a specific number of agents in, we have to keep track of the number of agents that already used this exit.
\newline
\underline{Function:}
\newline
loadConfig.m and applyForcesAndMove.m
\newline
\underline{New variables:}
\newline 
exit\underline{ }left
\newline
\underline{Modifications:}
\newline
For this purpose, we defined the matrix exit\underline{ }left, in which we store the number of agents who can exit for every exit (defined by his number).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{|>{\large}m{\textwidth}|} \hline
\bigskip
\textcolor{green}{\%make a zeros vector as long as exit\underline{ }count}
\newline
config.exit\underline{ }left = zeros(1,config.exit\underline{ }count);
\newline
\textcolor{green}{\%loop over all exits}
\newline
\textcolor{blue}{for} e=1:config.exit\underline{ }count
\newline
\textcolor{green}{\%build the exit\underline{ }nr matrix}
\newline
config.exit\underline{ }nr = config.exit\underline{ }nr + e*( img\underline{ }build(:, :, 1) == 0 \& img\underline{ }build(:, :, 2) == (256-e) \& img\underline{ }build(:, :, 3) == 0 ) ;
\newline
\textcolor{green}{\%build the exit\underline{ }left matrix}
\newline
config.exit\underline{ }left(1,e) = config.(sprintf(\textcolor{magenta}{'exit\underline{ }\%d\underline{ }nr'}, e)); save the number of agents the exit can hold
\newline
\textcolor{blue}{end}
\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation of the exit\underline{ }left matrix}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
In the loop where the forces are calculated and the agents moved, (in function applyForcesandMove.m) we added a piece of code, which updates the exit\underline{ }left matrix at every time-step.
\newline
First, we get the number of the current exit.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{|>{\large}m{\textwidth}|} \hline
\bigskip
\textcolor{green}{\%save current exit nr}
\newline
data.current\underline{ }exit = data.exit\underline{ }nr(round(newp(1)), round(newp(2)));
\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation to get the current exit number}
\end{figure}

Then we update the exit\underline{ }left matrix by counting down the number of agents allowed to exit by 1. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{|>{\large}m{\textwidth}|} \hline
\bigskip
\textcolor{green}{\%update exit\underline{ }left}
\newline
data.exit\underline{ }left(1,data.current\underline{ }exit) = data.exit\underline{ }left(1,data.exit\underline{ }nr(round(newp(1)), round(newp(2)))) - 1;
\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation to update the exit\underline{ }left}
\end{figure}

If the allowed number of agents exited the number is 0. Now we have to close the current exit, by changing it into a wall. Therefore we have to update the img\underline{ }wall matrix.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{|>{\large}m{\textwidth}|} \hline
\bigskip
\textcolor{green}{\%close exit if there is no more free space}
\newline
\textcolor{blue}{if} data.exit\underline{ } left(1,data.current\underline{ }exit) $<$ 1
\newline
\textcolor{green}{\%change current exit to wall}
\newline
data.floor(data.floor\underline{ }exit).img\underline{ }wall = data.floor(data.floor\underline{ }exit).img\underline{ }wall == 1 \textcolor{blue}{...}
\newline
| (data.exit\underline{ }nr == (data.current\underline{ }exit));
\newline
data.floor(data.floor\underline{ }exit).img\underline{ }exit = data.floor(data.floor\underline{ }exit).img\underline{ }exit == 1 \textcolor{blue}{...}
\newline
\& (data.exit\underline{ }nr \~ = (data.current\underline{ }exit));
\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation to close filled  boats}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Controlled evacuation}

\underline{Reason:}
\newline
With the goal of a faster evacuation, we tried to control the agents to go to specific exits. 
\newline
\underline{Assumption:}
\newline
We realised that the biggest problem-zones are the stairs. So, in order to get the agents as fast as possible away from the stairs, once they changed the floor, we decided to split the agents in two groups. 
One group only reaches one half of the exits and the other group for the others. 
\newline
\underline{Function:}
\newline
init\underline{ }agents.m, addDesiredForce.m, initEscapeRoutes\underline{ }even.m, initEscapeRoutes\underline{ }odd.m, addDesiredForce.m, initialize.m, initAgents.m, loadConfig.m
\newline
\underline{New variables:}
\newline 
- \textit{numbr}, each agents gets a number ( 0 or 1, selected randomly)
\newline
- \textit{control\underline{ }exit}, in the config file you can decide whether or not you want to have controlled exits during your simulation
\newline
\underline{Modifications:}
\newline
Essentially, we had to modify the calculation of the force dragging a specific agent to the nearest exit.  Therefore we wrote two new functions to init the escape routes. 
\newline
- initEscapeRoutes\underline{ }even.m, this function only considers the exits  which are identified by an even number.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{|>{\large}m{\textwidth}|} \hline
\bigskip
temp1=double(mod(data.exit\underline{ }nr,2)); \textcolor{green}{\%matrix in which every number which is even turns to zero, odd turns to one}
\newline
temp2=logical((data.floor(i).img\underline{ }exit)-(temp1));
\newline
boundary\underline{ }data(temp2)=-1; \textcolor{green}{\%boundary\underline{ }data considers only the exits with even numbers $-->$ -1 }
\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation to init escape routes for even numbers}
\end{figure}

$\rightarrow$ initEscapeRoutes\underline{ }.m, this function only considers the exits which are identified by an odd number

\bigskip
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Implementation to init escape routes for odd numbers}
\end{figure}

This as a basis we got two different directions to the next exit.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Ship Decks}

\underline{Ship Deck Implementation:}
\newline
The Costa Concordia has 14 decks which are all different from each other. They are connected by stairs and elevators in different configurations and they full fill different purposes. There are decks for entertainment, eating, shopping, sport and so on.
Due to the big differences of each deck, it is enormous time consuming to implement all these decks with all details in a model. So it is necessary to simplify the decks in a reasonable manner.
Further the picture source is not perfect in size and data type so there is a manual conversion needed.
In this chapter it is shown what assumptions were made and with which conversion techniques the decks were implemented into the model.
\newline
-Conversion
\newline
First of all the decks have to match each other in pixel size and position to allow a flawless connection of the decks. So the size of some decks has to be adjusted and the stair overlay has to be matched as good as possible.
Secondly doors, numbers, names and symbols are removed to have one connected surface without unreal obstacles.
\newline
Now that the surfaces are clean and connected, the colours have to be replaced by predefined colours of the code. Violet for spawn of agents, black for walls, red for upstairs, blue for downstairs and different green type for each rescue boat.
\newline
In the Figures \ref{Deck-stairs} and \ref{Deck-elevator} a small portion of a deck with stairs, rooms, doors and elevators is shown before and after conversion. In the converted picture is a red one pixel row included for the stairs, which is hard to see because of low contrast. The stairs conversion will just be explained in the next part.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
{\begin{minipage}[t]{7.4cm}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Decksetup-stairs.pdf}
\caption{Deck before conversion}
\label{Deck-stairs}
\end{minipage}}
{\begin{minipage}[t]{7.4cm}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Decksetup-elevator.pdf}
\caption{Deck after conversion}
\label{Deck-elevator}
\end{minipage}}
\end{figure}

In most of the cases stairs from one to another floor are designed in a spiral way to minimize the consumed space. That leads to a problem by implementing the stairs into the model. It is not possible to make a clean transition from one floor to another without using some tricks.
\newline
In the work "Modeling Situations of Evacuation in a Multi-level Building"\cite{Building}, which is the base of this project, are special additional floors to overcome the mentioned problem. These additional floors which represents the stairs, are a fine method to create an infinite amount of floors and connections without any trouble. But it needs that additional floor for each connection.
\newline
While there is a finite number of floors on the ship and the agents only march in the direction of the rescue floor the connection can be simplified. So there is a new technique used to get rid of these additional floors.
\newline
In the Figure \ref{Decktwostairs} a spiralling stairs connection between floor 01 and floor 02 is shown as example. The lines and arrows in light blue are used to clarify the technique.
The agents arrive from the left on floor 01 and go into the direction of the arrow until they reach the red one pixel line. There they are skipped up on the floor 02 and try to go to the red one pixel line again. The line is now moved 2 pixels to the right and the agents go around to be skipped again on the floor 03 and so on.
With that technique only a certain amount of floors can be realised corresponding to the pixel length of the stairs. But for the ship in that project it is sufficient, so that technique is used to implement the spiralling stairs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
{\begin{minipage}[t]{7.4cm}
\includegraphics [angle=-90, width=\textwidth]{Decktwostairs.pdf}
\caption{Stairs connection between floor 01 and floor 02}
\label{Decktwostairs}
\end{minipage}}
\end{figure}
-Similarities and Reduction
\newline
The most important floor for the simulation is of course floor 04 because it holds all the rescue boats as seen on the Figure \ref{Decksconverted}. There all agents have to pass and it is reasonable to have it very detailed. Floor 05 and 03 are the ones just above and beyond and will also have a non neglectable influence on the agent‚Äôs movement.
\newline
The further we move the less important the deck configuration gets, because it is assumed that the stairs will be the bottlenecks. As long as the stairs correspond good to the reality, the further decks can differ more.
So it is decided to convert deck 02, 03, 04 and 05 in detail and make a copy with adjusted stairs for each other floor. Floor 02 is used for the copy because it gets the closest to the floor 01, 06 and 07 and is by that still a good approximation.
\newline
Floor 08 until 14 differ more from floor 02 but as long as they are far away from floor 04 it will not have a big influence. These last floors are also smaller than floor 02 and therefore the amount of floors is reduced to only 11 with approximately the same area as the original 14 floors.

\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Even though modern ships are quite optimized in regard to evacuation time, they are always a compromise between safety and luxury. Therefore we are convinced to find a superior adjustment of the decks geometries to increase the survival rate.
\item Since the rescue boats can not be averaged but are rather concentrated over one or two decks, we consider the staircases as the bottlenecks.
\item In alinging this variables we are persuaded of a reduction of the overall evacuation time.
\item We suppose that smaller and evenly spread rescue boats combined with a higher quantity will scale the evacuation time down. Certainly there is going to be an optimum in size which we are willing to find.
\item By controlling the rescue we assume to detect a huge decrease in evacuation time. Further we have the hypothesis that disorder can be minimized. The crew who is familiar with the decks and the emergency exits is able to guide the passengers in minimum time to the rescue boats.
\item There are many parameters we do not model in our simulation. For example fire and smoke, the tilt of the ship or handicapped and petrified passengers are disregarded. By leaving out this details we get a very simplified model. However, by starting the optimization process by data of a nowadays passenger liner \cite{shipdecks} we hope to see some real evacuation dynamics in this system and therefore make conclusion on the fundamental questions.

\subsection{Simulation Results}
\subsubsection{Standard ship}
As listed above we were interested in the time in which a certain percentage of all agents was evacuated:

\end{tabular}
\caption{Standard simulation: Needed time to evacuate a certain percentage of all agents.}
\end{table}

Further our standard ship simulation showed the following performance:

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Modified room disposition}
As we expected the standard simulation revealed that hold-up problems occur because of the staircases. As the flow everywhere else was quite dynamic we abstained from adjusting the room disposition but instead we inserted an additional staircase. This simulation yielded the following results:

\end{tabular}

\end{minipage}}
\end{figure}
 
\subsubsection{Modified rescueboat size}
As we could see in the simulations with the standard ship, the rescueboats which are nearest to the stairs are filled first. This behavior is very intuitive. As soon as the nearest lifeboats are full, the agents continue to fill the other lifeboats. 
The greatest extension of the evacuation time occurs as follows:
Towards the end of the simulation, not all lifeboats are still open. Therefore leftover agents, which walked in the direction of a lifeboat that closed in the meantime,have to cross a big distance to reach a lifeboat with free space.\newline
We tried to avoid this delay by increasing the capacity of the lifeboats near to the stairs and removed some, which are the farthest away for the agents left over towards the end of the evacuation.

\subsection{Comparison}
\subsubsection{Standard - Modified room disposition}
The Analysis of the simulation results showed that there is a huge potential in saving evacuation time. By adding just one additional staircase we were able to reduce the overall evacuation time by almost 20 seconds. Further 50\% of all agents entered the exits approximately 13 seconds earlier compared to the stanard model. In contrast to that the rescueboat capacity utilisation remains basically the same. Another point which was actually not important for our research is that you get a much higher agent densitiy on the exit floor. 
\subsubsection{Standard - Modified rescueboat size}

As the results above show, there is no significant acceleration in the first part of the evacuation achieved by changing the distribution of the lifeboats .  
 But, there is clearly a difference in second half of the evacuation. The last 10\% of agents are evacuated 48.6 seconds faster and the last 1\% even 42.6 seconds faster. 
This decrease in evacuation time is an effect of the reduced time the last agents need to leave the exit-deck.
