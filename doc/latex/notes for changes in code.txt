vary the number of exits
-->different colour code
original code: exit, wall, staris up, stairs down
-->keep track of explicit exit -->different exits have different intensity 

floorchange
-->people move stairs up and down-->assumptions: above exit floor only move down, 

closing exits
-->one exit can only hold a specific number of agents. has to be closed if that number of agents exited.
-->recompile the colour code to change exit to wall
