## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

Dependent variables:

- Geometry of the deck
- Control of the passengerflow by crew members
- Rescue boats size, number, position

The target is to decrease evacuation time.
Measurements:
time to evacuate...
 first 10%
 first 50%
 first 90%
 all  100%
... of passengers


Independent variables:

- Number of passengers
- Rescue capacity
- Ship size, shape, space used by specific rooms

We assume to have 3 different kinds of rooms with different avereged numbers persons per area.

 
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

How much time can be saved by variing the dependent variables.
We are especially interested in the difference between controlled and uncontrolled passenger flow to see the benefit of a controlling crew.

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

We expect to see a big diffence by changing the contolling variable.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
