## How to run the code on Windows 7

(1) installation of .NET framework 4 (needed to run SDK, V 4.5 might also work... )
(2) installation of Windows SDK 7.1 (needed to compile c++-code in matlab). if there are issues while the installation. Deinstall visual c++ 2010 from your computer. problem occurs if you already installed newer versions of visual
(3) run compileC.m in MATLAB
(4) run simulate(config) im MATLAB where config is e.g. '../data/config1.conf'. see "../data/config_file_structure" to understand the config

config1 is an example of the multi-level-group from the last semester. It is a good test to see if the simulation works.
